The community container and dynamic infrastructure (un)conference

#### Next up: Jun 5-6th, **[ContainerDays Boston 2015](/events/2015-boston/)**

#### What is DynamicInfraDays?

DynamicInfraDays is a series of community (un)conferences to encourage discussion and learning on the subject of containers and dynamic infrastructure generally. The programme is a mix of OpenSpaces sessions and talks from users, contributors and extenders from all corners of the space.

The format and values of DynamicInfraDays are inspired by the tremendous achievements of [devopsdays](http://devopsdays.org/):

* Community-led, organized by experts and enthusiasts
* One or two-day events: a mix of talks, OpenSpaces sessions and workshops
* As affordable as possible: fees to cover costs only
* Great coffee and as good a Wifi connection as we can arrange ;-)

#### Events

##### Upcoming:

* 2015, June 5-6th, [ContainerDays Boston](/events/2015-boston/), Boston, MA, USA

##### Past:

#### I want to help and learn more!
