#### What is DynamicInfraDays?

DynamicInfraDays is a series of community (un)conferences to encourage discussion and learning on the subject of containers and dynamic infrastructure generally. The programme is a mix of OpenSpaces sessions and talks from users, contributors and extenders from all corners of the space.

The format and values of DynamicInfraDays are inspired by the tremendous achievements of [devopsdays](http://devopsdays.org/):

* Community-led, organized by experts and enthusiasts
* One or two-day events: a mix of talks, OpenSpaces sessions and workshops
* As affordable as possible: fees to cover costs only
* Great coffee and as good a Wifi connection as we can arrange ;-)
