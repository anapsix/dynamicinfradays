### Talks

#### <a name="tsuru"></a>_Growing Up With Docker: How Docker and Tsuru Have Evolved_ <span style="font-size: smaller">- [Francisco Souza](#franciscos)</span>

With so many people now using Docker, it's easy to forget that the project is not that old and has come a long way since "that" presentation at PyCon, back in 2013. Tsuru, an open-source PaaS, started a year before Docker and, as a very early adopter, has followed the evolution of the Docker platform every step of the way.

Francisco will introduce Tsuru and describe the motivations behind Tsuru's
adoption of Docker. He'll give a "from the trenches" account of the evolution and growing pains of the Docker ecosystem and discuss the current state of affairs of the ecosystem.

He'll also demonstrate how Tsuru uses Docker today, and what improvements and new functionality he feels will be most exciting going forward.
