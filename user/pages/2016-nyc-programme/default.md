### Talks

#### <a name="tsuru"></a>_Growing Up With Docker: How Docker and Tsuru Have Evolved_ <span style="font-size: smaller">- [Francisco Souza](#franciscos)</span>

With so many people now using Docker, it's easy to forget that the project is not that old and has come a long way since "that" presentation at PyCon, back in 2013. Tsuru, an open-source PaaS, started a year before Docker and, as a very early adopter, has followed the evolution of the Docker platform every step of the way.

Francisco will introduce Tsuru and describe the motivations behind Tsuru's
adoption of Docker. He'll give a "from the trenches" account of the evolution and growing pains of the Docker ecosystem and discuss the current state of affairs of the ecosystem.

He'll also demonstrate how Tsuru uses Docker today, and what improvements and new functionality he feels will be most exciting going forward.

#### <a name="secrets"></a>_The Secure Introduction Problem: Getting Secrets Into Containers_ <span style="font-size: smaller">- [jeff Mitchell](#jeffm)</span>

Developing a usable approach to secret management in a container environment is a balancing act between functionality and attack surface. An understanding of security must be aligned with an understanding of practical workflows and capabilities and limitations of container technologies.

The Vault team tackles this problem on a daily basis. In a layered approach accessible to security novices and experts alike, Jeff will explore the ways in which Vault thinks about security, and will describe the secure introduction problem.

He'll talk about the security principles encoded into Vault, how these can be exposed in a usable way to enable secure introduction and secret management at scale, and what implications these approaches have for the way we develop, distribute and run containerized applications.

#### <a name="jeffm"></a>Jeff Mitchell

Jeff has hacked on dozens of open-source projects over the past decade. He joined HashiCorp after contributing to Consul, Terraform, and Vault while working as an infrastructure architect at Akamai.

He is now living the dream of being paid to work on open-source software full-time as the project lead on Vault. He is currently enjoying life in Boston with his wife, daughter, and two excessively needy cats.
