This document describes the services and costs associated with the **Silver sponsorship tier** at ContainerDays NYC 2015.

#### Sponsor: Docker, Inc.
#### Tier: Silver sponsor

##### Description

This sponsorship tier includes:

* 2x tickets for registration to the event
* 1x vendor table (see below for specifications)
* Sponsor's logo to be included in the "Silver sponsors" section of the event website: [http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-nyc/#sponsors](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-nyc/#sponsors)

##### Cost

The cost of the Silver sponsorship tier is USD 750.00 (seven hundred and fifty US dollars).

Payment terms: on receipt of invoice.

#### Event details
 
##### Participants

We expect about 120 attendees, the majority in a technical role with interest in introducing and/or active experience in implementing container and related technologies. Please be aware that ContainerDays events are informal,  "unconference" style events for technical practitioners.

##### Staffing suggestions

You will get the most mileage from your vendor table by sending technical staff prepared to engage in the conference sessions.

**Sponsorships do not include speaking slots**. Your attending staff is welcome and encouraged to propose topics for, and participate in, the OpenSpaces sessions and workshops.

##### Facilities

Sponsor tables are 6' x 2'; we estimate that each sponsor with a table will have roughly 6' x 4' of space overall. Power strips will be run to the tables. Wireless internet is provided, but please do not rely on it for critical meetings. Wired internet access will not be available.

There are no facilities for complex booth setups, shipping and receiving of large or bulky items, or other major industry conference-style arrangements. Please plan for a way to collect contact information from interested attendees, as there is no automated lead capture system.

All posters and banners need to be free-standing; we are not allowed to affix any materials to the walls or windows.

##### Shipping

Please arrange to bring any items, such as popup banners and promotional material, on the day of the event. The venue may be able to receive and store small items for maximum one or two days before the event. Please check with the ContainerDays NYC 2015 organizers first if you need to ship directly to the venue.

Items need to be hand-carryable or in a rollable suitcase, as we will not be able to use the freight elevator for the event. If you have essential items that cannot be transported any other way, please get in touch with the organizers.

Please plan to remove everything you bring at the end of the event. Items may not be left behind afterwards. [Fedex](http://local.fedex.com/ny/new-york/?q=11%20Times%20Sq%20NY%2010036) and [UPS](https://www.ups.com/dropoff?txtQuery=11%20Times%20Sq%20NY%2011036&reqType=results) both have drop boxes and offices close to the venue.

##### Contact details

Please contact the ContainerDays NYC 2015 organizers at [2015-nyc-sponsorship@dynamicinfradays.org](mailto:2015-nyc-sponsorship@dynamicinfradays.org) in case of any questions.
