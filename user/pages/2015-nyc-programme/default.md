#### <a name="boydh"></a>Boyd Hemphill

Boyd is a DevOps raconteur and thought leader in the silicon hills of Austin, Texas. Boyd founded Austin DevOps when he learned this thing he was doing had a name. Boyd organizes the Docker Austin meet up and put together ContainerDays Austin, the first ever DynamicInfraDays event.

In his professional life, Boyd has been a developer (PL/SQL and PHP), DBA (Oracle and MySQL), and system administrator. He sees Docker as containers for mere mortals in the same way Slicehost was virtualization for mere mortals in 2009. Currently Boyd is the Director of Evangelism for StackEngine where he educates and espouses DevOps practices as they relate to Linux Containers.

You can find Boyd on Twitter at [@behemphi](https://twitter.com/behemphi).
