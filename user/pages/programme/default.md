#### Brian 'Redbeard' Harrington

Brian Harrington, also known as Redbeard, is a principal architect at CoreOS.  He is developer, hacker, and technical writer in the areas of open-source development and systems administration. His time spent in both defensive and offensive computing have combined with his readings of classical anarchism to present new ideas in organizational hierarchies for software development.

He currently resides in Oakland, CA and was grudgingly elected president of the hackerspace HacDC.
