### Talks

#### <a name="briefhist"></a>_A Brief History of Containers_ <span style="font-size: smaller">- [Jeff Victor](#jeffv)</span>

Containers are a form of operating system virtualization that is subtly different from virtual machines. The concept has evolved over time, and Jeff will discuss the history of OSV and the roles of current implementations.

#### <a name="elbatscale"></a>_Elastic Load Balancing at Scale with Mesos and Docker_ <span style="font-size: smaller">- [Tom Petr](#tomp)</span>

The HubSpot product is made up of over 200 separately deployable web APIs. While investing in a Service Oriented Architecture has many benefits, it can also expose new infrastructure scaling challenges.

In this talk, Tom will discuss the challenges faced, and how his team built a Mesos-based software load balancer using Docker that improves reliability, decreases human intervention, and saves money.

#### <a name="journey"></a>_Running Docker, Mesos and More in Production: The Journey to Container Adoption in the Enterprise_ <span style="font-size: smaller">- Igor Moochnick</span>

Enterprises have well-established cultures, technology stacks and processes. Now containers are changing the way we think about applications, artifacts and deployment processes. They also bring new challenges along the way, especially since the technology is still young and constantly changing.

Igor will discuss how this new set of technologies is finding its way in the enterprise, and what we've learned so far.
