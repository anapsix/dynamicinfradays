### Talks

#### <a name="briefhist"></a>_A Brief History of Containers_ <span style="font-size: smaller">- [Jeff Victor](#jeffv)</span>

Containers are a form of operating system virtualization that is subtly different from virtual machines. The concept has evolved over time, and Jeff will discuss the history of OSV and the roles of current implementations.

#### <a name="journey"></a>_Running Docker, Mesos and More in Production: The Journey to Container Adoption in the Enterprise_ <span style="font-size: smaller">- Igor Moochnick</span>

Enterprises have well-established cultures, technology stacks and processes. Now containers are changing the way we think about applications, artifacts and deployment processes. They also bring new challenges along the way, especially since the technology is still young and constantly changing.

We're going to discuss how this new set of technologies is finding its way in the enterprise, and what we've learned so far.

#### <a name="brianh"></a>Brian 'Redbeard' Harrington

Brian Harrington, also known as Redbeard, is a principal architect at CoreOS.  He is developer, hacker, and technical writer in the areas of open-source development and systems administration. His time spent in both defensive and offensive computing have combined with his readings of classical anarchism to present new ideas in organizational hierarchies for software development.

He currently resides in Oakland, CA and was grudgingly elected president of the hackerspace HacDC.

#### <a name="jeffv"></a>Jeff Victor

Jeff's 28-year computer career has included software development, system and network administration, and consulting. He was the Principal Author of the book _Solaris 10 System Virtualization Essentials_, and the creator of the Solaris Zones FAQ and the 'zonestat' open-source program.

Jeff received a Bachelor of Science degree (Computer Science) from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. In his spare time, he builds and launches high-power rockets and manages automated wildlife cameras. He lives in New York with his wife and daughter.

### Workshops

#### <a name="dcpana"></a>Creating Multi-container Apps with Docker Compose and Panamax <span style="font-size: smaller">- 2h, Intermediate</span>

So you've run a few standalone containers, now it's time to start piecing them together! Learn how to use Docker Compose and Panamax.io to create real multi-container apps.

**Prerequisities**

Please ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

* If you're running Max OS X or Windows, [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#installation-and-set-up) installed in boot2docker or on your Linux system
* [Panamax](http://panamax.io/get-panamax/)

#### <a name="springlatt"></a>Providing App-level Abstraction and Scaling with Spring Boot and Lattice <span style="font-size: smaller">- 2h, Intermediate</span>

Containers are not new in general and certainly not to app developers in particular: servlet containers provided similar transportability of applications.

We will look at a very simple Spring Boot app as an example. Spring Boot is a lightweight container that manages dependencies and abstracts the infrastructural complexities. We then look at Lattice, a platform for running containerized workloads that provides scalability, Blue/Green deployment, etc.
