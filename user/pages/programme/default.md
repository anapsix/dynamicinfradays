Brian Harrington, also known as Redbeard, is a principal architect at CoreOS.  He is developer, hacker, and technical writer in the areas of open-source development and systems administration. His time spent in both defensive and offensive computing have combined with his readings of classical anarchism to present new ideas in organizational hierarchies for software development.

He currently resides in Oakland, CA and was grudgingly elected president of the hackerspace HacDC.

#### Jeff Victor

Jeff's 28-year computer career has included software development, system and network administration, and consulting. He was the Principal Author of the book _Solaris 10 System Virtualization Essentials_, and the creator of the Solaris Zones FAQ and the 'zonestat' open-source program.

Jeff received a Bachelor of Science degree (Computer Science) from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. In his spare time, he builds and launches high-power rockets and manages automated wildlife cameras. He lives in New York with his wife and daughter.
