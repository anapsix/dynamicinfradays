## What is an unconference?

If you've never been to an unconference or OpenSpaces event before, don't worry - it's a really easy format to get into. You may want to [read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) for some background.

## Programme

From real-world implementation lessons to hands-on getting started workshops, we're trying to ensure there's something here for everyone - whether you're a container expert or are only just getting started, or can make both Friday and Saturday or attend only one of the days.

### Workshops

We're looking forward to thought-provoking talks and discussions, but at some point we're sure you'll also want to get your hands dirty. That's why the second half of Saturday is all about workshops, where you can team up and spend some keyboard time trying out interesting ideas and technologies.

We'd like to apply the unconference idea to the workshops, too. We'll have some guided, introductory sessions if you're looking to get started. We're also encouraging you to team up with a couple of other participants, get hold of one of the speakers, sponsors or other experts running around, and try out some of the tools and concepts that come up in discussion.

Please note that the programme is provisional and subject to change.
