## What is ContainerDays Boston?

ContainerDays Boston is a community (un)conference to encourage discussion and learning on the subject of containers and dynamic infrastructure generally. The programme is a mix of OpenSpaces sessions and talks from users, contributors and extenders from all corners of the space.

Whether you're an expert or new to the space, there'll be plenty for you to learn and discuss. It's an unconference, so _you_ get to pick the topics!
