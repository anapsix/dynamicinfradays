# DynamicInfraDays is coming!
## First up: **[Container Days Austin 2015](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-austin/)**

DynamicInfraDays will be a community-based conference focused on the emerging possibilities of dynamic infrastructure, including containers and other technologies. The format is likely to follow that of the excellent [devopsdays](http://devopsdays.org/) events:

* Community-driven, organized by experts and enthusiasts
* One or two-day events: some presentations followed by open-space unconference sessions
* As affordable as possible: fees to cover costs only
* Great coffee and as good a Wifi connection as we can arrange ;-)

[Container Days Austin](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-austin/) is the first event currently planned and will take place in Austin, TX in March 2015. [ContainerDays Boston](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-boston/) in Boston, MA will follow on June 5-6.  
If you're interested in volunteering or attending, would like to sponsor or have a venue that you could make available, we'd love to [hear from you](mailto:info@dynamicinfradays.org)!
