# DynamicInfraDays is coming!
## First up: **[Container Days Austin 2015](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-austin/)**

DynamicInfraDays will be a community-based conference focused on the emerging possibilities of dynamic infrastructure, including containers and other technologies. The format is likely to follow that of the excellent devopsdays events:

Community-driven, organized by experts and enthusiasts
One or two-day events: some presentations followed by open-space unconference sessions
As affordable as possible: fees to cover costs only
Great coffee and as good a Wifi connection as we can arrange ;-)
Container Days Austin is the first event currently planned and will take place in Austin, TX in March 2015.   
If you're interested in volunteering or attending, would like to sponsor or have a venue that you could make available, we'd love to hear from you!
