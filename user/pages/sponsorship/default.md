#### Participant details

We expect about 100 attendees, the majority in a technical role with interest in introducing and/or active experience in implementing container and related technologies. Please be aware that ContainerDays events are informal,  ["unconference"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) style events for technical practitioners.

#### Facilities

[Microsoft NERD](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-boston/#location) has kindly agreed to receive small items, such as promotional material. Due to lack of suitable storage facilities, these may not arrive more than 3 days prior to the event, and may not be left behind afterwards.

There are no facilities for complex booth setups, shipping and receiving of large or bulky items, or other major industry conference-style arrangements.

#### Staffing suggestions

You will get the most mileage from your vendor table by sending technical staff prepared to engage in the conference sessions.

With the exception of **Platinum** and **Gold** tiers, which come with short "shout-out" opportunities to present your company, sponsorships do not include speaking slots. Your attending staff is welcome and encouraged to propose topics for, and participate in, the OpenSpaces sessions and workshops.

#### Invoicing

You will be invoiced for your sponsorship. Please provide your company name, physical address, contact information, and the sponsorship tier in which you are interested.
