#### <a name="participants"></a>Participant details

We expect about 160 attendees, the majority in a technical role with interest in introducing and/or active experience in implementing container and related technologies. Please be aware that DynamicInfraDays events are informal,  ["unconference"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) style events for technical practitioners.

#### <a name="staffing"></a>Staffing suggestions

You will get the most mileage from your vendor table by sending technical staff prepared to engage in the conference sessions.

With the exception of **Platinum** and **Gold** tiers, which come with short "shout-out" opportunities to present your company, sponsorships do **not** include speaking slots. Your attending staff is welcome and encouraged to propose topics for, and participate in, the OpenSpaces sessions, workshops and Ignite talks.

#### <a name="facilities"></a>Facilities

Sponsor tables are 5' x 1.5'; we estimate that each sponsor with a table will have roughly 6' x 4' of space overall. Power strips will be run to the tables. Wireless internet is provided, but please do not rely on it for critical meetings. Wired internet access will not be available.

There are no facilities for complex booth setups, shipping and receiving of large or bulky items, or other major industry conference-style arrangements. Please plan for a way to collect contact information from interested attendees, as there is no automated lead capture system.

All posters and banners need to be free-standing; we are not allowed to affix any materials to the walls or windows.

#### <a name="shipping"></a>Shipping

Please arrange to bring any items, such as popup banners and promotional material, on the day of the event. [Microsoft New York](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2016-nyc/#location) may be able to receive and store small items for maximum one or two days before the event. Please [check with us](#questions) first if you need to ship directly to the venue.

Items need to be hand-carryable or in a rollable suitcase, as we will not be able to use the freight elevator for the event. If you have essential items that cannot be transported any other way, please [get in touch](#questions) and we'll try our best to make things work.

Please plan to remove everything you bring at the end of the event. Items may not be left behind afterwards. <a href="http://local.fedex.com/search/?q=11%20Times%20Sq%20NY%2010036">Fedex</a> and <a href="https://www.ups.com/dropoff?txtQuery=11%20Times%20Sq%20NY%2011036&reqType=results">UPS</a> both have drop boxes and offices close to the venue.

#### <a name="parking"></a>Parking

There are a number of [parking garages](https://www.google.com/maps/search/parking/@40.7578811,-73.990092,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!2m7!3m6!1sparking!2sMicrosoft+Technology+Center,+640+8th+Ave,+New+York,+NY+10019,+United+States!3s0x89c25856e81cdc7d:0xcb6b70d1bb597301!4m2!1d-73.9896509!2d40.75672) close to the venue. However, parking is expensive and traffic in the area is generally bad, so we strongly encourage attendees to use mass transit where possible.

#### <a name="accommodation"></a>Accommodation

Unfortunately, accommodation in NYC gets expensive quickly, and we recommend that you look at accommodation soon if you're coming from out of town. Due to the numbers involved, we currently don't have any block rates with hotels.

#### <a name="invoicing"></a>Invoicing

You will be invoiced for your sponsorship. Please provide your company name, physical address, contact information, and the sponsorship tier in which you are interested.
